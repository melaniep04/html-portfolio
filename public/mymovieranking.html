<h1>The Best Movies According to Melanie</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie for numerous reasons. Not only has it won multiple awards, showing that it is somewhat objectively well done, but it also pulls at your heartstrings with the realistic storyline.</p>
<h3>She's the Man</h3>
<p>As someone who adores chick-flicks, this is the best one in my opinion. It genuinely has so many funny moments and the plot twists are so good.</p>
<h3>Joker</h3>
<p>I had to mention this movie, as I've seen it more times than I can count. I love thrillers and appreciate the perspective that this movie gives of the villain's point of view.</p>
