<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am so excited to be on this new journey of learning as a self-taught software developer. 
  I dedicate time daily to improving my programming knowledge and skillset, as I strive to make
  a career pivot into the tech industry.
</p>

<p>What drew me specifically to programming was the fact that it utilizes both nalytical and creative thinking.
  I also appreciate a good challenge, which makes this new pursuit even more appealing to me.
</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I do have other interests other than learning how to code. If the weather
  is nice outside, I love to go on walks in my neighborhood. I also enjoy crocheting fun items for myself
  or others!
